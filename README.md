# Transforming authority records as XML-files into Linked Data N-Triples
This directory shares code from the research project "Personen-Datenbank Zeitgeschichte" (Authority Database Contemporary History).
The project aims to ensure the FAIRification and the sustainable preservation of an authority record database held by the institute.
The project started in August 2019 at the Institut f端r Zeitgeschichte M端nchen - Berlin / Leibniz Institute for Contemporary History and is led by Francesco Gelati.
The coding prototypes aim to transform a non standard-compliant XML-export of archival authority records into Linked Data N-Triples by means of XLS mapping files.
